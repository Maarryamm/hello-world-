# hello-world-
first github repository hehe:3 i dream of becoming a front-end developer with a plausible back-end skill set. to honor this dream, Iâ€™ll be learning courses on freecodecamp every summer until I achieve it. the ideal life can be manifested through creativity &amp; determination, a stern need for perfection hauls the door further.
